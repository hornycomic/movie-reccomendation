I want a movie which is about some kind of apocalypse,"For an apocalypse-themed movie, I recommend you watch ""World War Z."" It's a thrilling sci-fi action film starring Brad Pitt, where a former UN investigator is thrown into a race against time to find a way to stop a global zombie pandemic. The movie is packed with intense action sequences, suspenseful moments, and a gripping storyline. It's a perfect choice if you're in the mood for a gripping end-of-the-world scenario. Enjoy the movie!",,,2024-09-13 11:58:04.908263
